				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="assets/images/profile_pic.jpg" alt="Lokesh" id="me" height="220" width="165">
				<p class="bio">Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring programmer enrolled in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. Over the next few months, I will be learning how to be a full-stack software engineer and complete a number of projects to cultivate my skills.</p> 
				<p class="bio">Prior to enrolling in the coding bootcamp, I graduated from the University of Chicago with degrees in mathematics and economics and worked as an investment banker in San Fracisco for three years. I was born and raised in Austin and am excited to be back in the live music capital of the world. During my free time, I enjoy reading, watching sports, and spending time in the outdoors. </p>
